=============

Some projects from my graphics class.

-------------

## Heightmap:  
  This program takes an image as input, to be used as a heightmap. It displays a 6-sided skybox and a floating heightmap. The world can be rotated and translated on all three axis by dragging the mouse while holding [left or middle] mouse button and (for translation) the CTRL button. The heightmap can be scaled on all axis by holding [left or middle] mouse button and the SHIFT button.  
  Color themes (for the heightmap) can be cycled through by hitting the TAB button.

## Roller Coaster Simulator:
  This program takes a text file as input, to be used as spline control points. The program interpolates over the given points to create a smooth, connected curve that is rendered as a rainbow roller coaster track. The camera follows the track as if it were a coaster. A simplified gravity model is applied to accelerate/decelerate the camera.  
  Lighting themes can be cycled through by hitting the TAB button.
  [Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7MZqcCsh8icMWlud2Jkb0hBNkE/view?usp=sharing). The rendering for this video made the coaster look much slower than it actually would be when running the program.
